# User Stories

As a user I want to be able to search for meetups that match my search criteria, so I can attend meetups that interest me

As a user I want to see the dates of the meetups, so I won't try to attend a 
meetup that has already taken place

As a user I want to be able to mark the events that I want to attend, so I can keep track of meetups that I want to go to 

As a user I want to be able to rate a meetup, so I can give feedback to the meetup organizer
